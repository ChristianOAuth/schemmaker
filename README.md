schemmaker
==========

scheMMaker draws fancy schematics out of netlists!

* inside examples/ run ./run_examples.sh to let scheMMaker do some work for the
  vhdl-netlists inside examples/

* to start generating a schematic simply call:

$ python schemmaker.py <vhdl-file> [output_filename]


ATTENTION: this is still _very_ experimental and 
barely usable for circuits/netlists, which do not 
exactly have the desired formatting!
